# Clonebook

A multi-platform social network clone.

## Overview

Clonebook is a clone project of a wellknown social networking platform.  I am using Clonebook as a learning opportunity to create a full stack web app as well as a counterpart mobile app built for iOS 13.4 and above.


## Pre-project goals
### Web app

While I have made static web pages in the past, as well as some small scale web app projects, this is the first project of this scale that I am attempting.

My goal with Clonebook is to create a full stack socail networking web app with an integrated mobile app.  Users will be able to register with Clonebook, create a "home" page, create posts which can be shared, add friends, and like/comment on friends posts.

I already have an understanding in some of the technologies that I'll be using in this project, and no prior knowldge in others, so this will be a long term project with functionality being added as I learn how to implement it.
